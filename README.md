sharemore
=========

Share More is a collection of Send plugins for Android (initally support for Kippt API). 
See license.txt for licensing information.

What is it?
-----------

This project now has:
- Send to Kippt plugin (quick)
- Preferences view
- Support for Android 4.0 and 4.1

I expect there to be UX peculiarities and bugs still to iron out. Let's consider it a slightly relaxed Beta for now.

There is a good Kippt client available in Play store, so I'll concentrate on other plugins whenever project is continued.

Kippt Features
--------------
- Select "Share Page" on browser or similar function on other apps
- Share anything in textual format that contains an URL to Kippt
- Automatically expand shortened URLs before saving to Kippt
- Share plugin asks username and password once and after that use API token to authenticate.

Quick Save:
- Saves shared item to Inbox
- Preferences to mark Quick saves "Read Later" and/or Starred
- Save all the the URLs mentioned in the Tweet

Not yet:
- Notifications

Not at all (for this app):
- This app doesn't aim to be an app for browsing Kippt content or feeds.

Next steps:
-----------
- Getting started UI
- Authentication for paranoids (just tokens)
- Better automated tests
- Make it faster
- Android market place
- More share plugins

Planned features:
-----------------
- Notifications about new items in specified Kippt list
- Share to a specific file in Dropbox
- Share to a predetermined email address
- Share to App.NET(?)
