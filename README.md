sharemore
=========

Share More is a collection of Send plugins for Android (initally support for Kippt API). 
See license.txt for licensing information.

What is it?
-----------

This project now has:
- Send to Kippt plugin (quick and with editing)
- Preferences view
- Support for Android 4.0 and 4.1

I expect there to be UX peculiarities and bugs still to iron out. Let's consider it an Beta for now. This app will be made available in Google Play early September as paid app, but app also will be always available as GPL software. 

Kippt Features
--------------
- Select "Share Page" on browser or similar function on other apps
- Share anything in textual format that contains an URL to Kippt
- Automatically expand shortened URLs before saving to Kippt
- Share plugin asks username and password once and after that use API token to authenticate.

Quick Save:
- Saves shared item to Inbox
- Preferences to mark Quick saves "Read Later" and/or Starred

Save to Kippt:
- Edit title, select list, edit URL, add notes to Saved item
- Mark Read Later or Starred
- For shared Tweets title updated from the URL to be saved
- Shortened URLs deshortened before saving

Not yet:
- Save all the the URLs mentioned in the Tweet
- Notifications

Not at all (for this app):
- This app doesn't aim to be an app for browsing Kippt content or feeds. I *might* do that as a separate project, but I expect Kippt community to create one soon enough for all of us to enjoy.

Next steps:
-----------
- Getting started UI
- Authentication for paranoids (just tokens)
- Better automated tests
- Make it faster
- Android market place
- More share plugins

Planned features:
-----------------
- Notifications about new items in specified Kippt list
- Share to a specific file in Dropbox
- Share to a predetermined email address
- Share to App.NET(?)
